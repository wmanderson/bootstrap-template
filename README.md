# jQuery Landing Page

- For this project we will be using the attached front end to enhance it with jQuery.
  - Step 1: Swap out the class "affix-top" on the nav for "affix" when the scroll distance reaches past 50 pixels.
- Step 2: When the navbar links are clicked, animate a page scroll down to that anchor.
- Step 3: Use Bootstrap scrollspy to change the navbar links on scroll.
- Step 4: Implement Font Awesome icons where applicable.
- Step 5: Use [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) and [WOW JS](https://github.com/matthieua/WOW) to fade in elements of your choice on page scroll.
